We intend to analyze Cannabis flowers from MMJ strains grown at Connecticut Pharmaceutical Solutions (CPS). Samples taken weekly during flower development will be analyzed. THCa and CBDa synthases, as well as genes encoding enzymes involved in terpene synthesis, and condensation of monoterpene pathway-derived geranyl diphosphate with olivetolic acid (leading to CBG synthesis) will be surveyed. The hypothesis underlying this work is that cannabinoid end-product (CBD/THC) generation will be correlated with differences in expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. Our preliminary studies suggest that THCa and CBDa synthase expression will be correlated with end-product production. Studies could include evaluating gene expression in flowers of plants grown under different production regimes at CPS. \\nThe Principal Investigator has developed some high-throughput screening methods to monitor commercial cultural management strategies that might impact Cannabis immune defenses against pathogen infection. The screening method involves germination of CPS?s Cannabis seeds in the presence of fungal pathogens and monitoring initial growth. A number of commercially available products (i.e. Messenger and Milsana) that activate plant immune systems will be tested using this screen. We will monitor Cannabis pathogen defense gene activation in seedlings exposed to a fungal pathogen using this screen. We will also expand this screen to include cuttings of CPS Cannabis strains used for commercial clonal propagation of plants. When outbreaks of Powdery mildew occur on MMJ Cannabis strains at CPS, we intend to have the infected leaves and flowers brought to UConn to analyze and to identify Cannabis genes that are upregulated upon disease infection. \\nA number of plant hormones are known to affect plant development, trichome density, as well as flower growth (size), among many other phenotypes. Specifically, the plant hormones jasmonic acid, Gibberellins, and Abscisic acid and can affect plants in ways that have relevance to MMJ production and breeding. Jasmonic acid has been shown to increase trichome density in tomato leaves and Arabidopsis thaliana leaves and flowers. We will apply jasmonic acid to Cannabis to study its effects on floral trichome density.\", \"not applicable\", \"not applicable\", null, \"0\", \"0\", \"1533603\" ]\n, [ \"row-rkb3~gkji-k5m9\", \"00000000-0000-0000-2EAE-F0C9D2B9B9C9\", 0, 1630011993, null, 1630011993, null, \"{ }\", \"MMRP.0000002\", \"ACTIVE\", \"NONE\", \"A PROOF OF CONCEPT, OPEN LABEL PROSPECTIVE PILOT STUDY OF CANNABIS USE IN TRAUMA PATIENTS WITH MULTI\", null, \"SAINT FRANCIS HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL CENTER, HARTFORD, CT, 06105-1208\", \"In order to investigate the effects of cannabis on multiple rib fracture patients, a study comparing the use of opiates and the use of cannabis will be conducted. Through a voluntary, proof of concept study, trauma patients with three or more rib fractures, managed non-operatively will be consented to participate upon discharge from the hospital. Reaching a total of 60 patients, 30 patients will participate in the control arm, taking a standard oxycodone/OxyContin regimen for pain treatment and a second group of 30 patients will be prescribed oxycodone in addition to cannabis dissolving sublingual spray and cannabis capsules, obtained from a certified medical marijuana dispensary. Patients will be followed for six weeks with regular outpatient visits every other week. Their opioid use will be tracked by pill counting, prescription monitoring, and a patient journal. In addition, albumin levels will be tested upon rib fracture presentation and completion of two month treatment period. The primary outcomes include average milligrams of oxycodone required per day and patient average daily pain score. Secondary outcomes include nutritional status, average daily activity score, rates of readmission and pneumonia and number of outpatient visits to the Emergency Department and trauma provider(s). Through extensive research, it is hypothesized multiple rib fracture patients in the intervention arm will demonstrate a decrease in  opiate use and average daily pain score as well as an improved nutritional status and average activity score, decreased rates of readmission and pneumonia and fewer visits to the Emergency Department and trauma providers.\", \"Multiple rib fractures with minimal or no other injuries (AIS for other systems < 4)\", \"10 mg THC/ 10 mg CBD capsule scheduled BID dose with 4 mg oral spray for breakthrough pain\", null, \"30\", \"0\", \"1383391\" ]\n, [ \"row-m8dk-5avm.iw5x\", \"00000000-0000-0000-FFD3-0E2D365EAB8E\", 0, 1630011993, null, 1630011993, null, \"{ }\", \"MMRP.0000006\", \"ACTIVE\", \"NONE\", \"YALE STRESS CENTER, YALE UNIVERSITY\", \"YALE STRESS CENTER\", \"STRESS CENTER, YALE UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MED YALE, NEW HAVEN, CT, 06519-1717\", \"The Yale Stress Center conducts cutting edge research to understand the effects of stress, trauma and pain on risk of developing physical and mental health disorders.
